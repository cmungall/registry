name: Golm Metabolome Database Analyte
description: Golm Metabolome Database (GMD) provides public access to custom mass spectral libraries, metabolite profiling experiments as well as additional information and tools. For GC-MS profiling analyses, polar metabolite extracts are chemically converted, i.e. derivatised into less polar and volatile compounds, so called analytes.  This collection references analytes.
