description: Cube-DB is a database of pre-evaluated results for detection of functional divergence in human/vertebrate protein families. It analyzes comparable taxonomical samples for all paralogues under consideration, storing functional specialisation at the level of residues. The data are presented as a table of per-residue scores, and mapped onto related structures where available.
