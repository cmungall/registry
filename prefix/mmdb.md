name: Molecular Modeling Database
description: The Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB) is a database of experimentally determined structures obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Since structures are known for a large fraction of all protein families, structure homologs may facilitate inference of biological function, or the identification of binding or catalytic sites.
