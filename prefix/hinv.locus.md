name: H-InvDb Locus
description: H-Invitational Database (H-InvDB) is an integrated database of human genes and transcripts. It provides curated annotations of human genes and transcripts including gene structures, alternative splicing isoforms, non-coding functional RNAs, protein functions, functional domains, sub-cellular localizations, metabolic pathways, protein 3D structure, genetic polymorphisms (SNPs, indels and microsatellite repeats), relation with diseases, gene expression profiling, molecular evolutionary features, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and gene families/groups. This datatype provides access to the 'Locus' view.
