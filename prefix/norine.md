name: NORINE
description: Norine is a database dedicated to nonribosomal peptides (NRPs). In bacteria and fungi, in addition to the traditional ribosomal proteic biosynthesis, an alternative ribosome-independent pathway called NRP synthesis allows peptide production. The molecules synthesized by NRPS contain a high proportion of nonproteogenic amino acids whose primary structure is not always linear, often being more complex and containing cycles and branchings.
