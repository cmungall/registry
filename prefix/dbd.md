name: DBD
description: The DBD (transcription factor database) provides genome-wide transcription factor predictions for organisms across the tree of life. The prediction method identifies sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors through homology using profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) of domains from Pfam and SUPERFAMILY. It does not include basal transcription factors or chromatin-associated proteins.
