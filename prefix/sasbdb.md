description: Small Angle Scattering Biological Data Bank (SASBDB) is a curated repository for small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and neutron scattering (SANS) data and derived models. Small angle scattering (SAS) of X-ray and neutrons provides structural information on biological macromolecules in solution at a resolution of 1-2 nm. SASBDB provides freely accessible and downloadable experimental data, which are deposited together with the relevant experimental conditions, sample details, derived models and their fits to the data.
