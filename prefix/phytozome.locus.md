name: Phytozome Locus
description: Phytozome is a project to facilitate comparative genomic studies amongst green plants. Famlies of orthologous and paralogous genes that represent the modern descendents of ancestral gene sets are constructed at key phylogenetic nodes. These families allow easy access to clade specific orthology/paralogy relationships as well as clade specific genes and gene expansions. This collection references locus information.
