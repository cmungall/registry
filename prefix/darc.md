name: DARC
description: DARC (Database of Aligned Ribosomal Complexes) stores available cryo-EM (electron microscopy) data and atomic coordinates of ribosomal particles from the PDB, which are aligned within a common coordinate system. The aligned coordinate system simplifies direct visualization of conformational changes in the ribosome, such as subunit rotation and head-swiveling, as well as direct comparison of bound ligands, such as antibiotics or translation factors.
