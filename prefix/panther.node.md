name: PANTHER Node
description: The PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) Classification System is a resource that classifies genes by their functions, using published scientific experimental evidence and evolutionary relationships to predict function even in the absence of direct experimental evidence. PANTHER tree is a key element of the PANTHER System to represent ‘all’ of the evolutionary events in the gene family. PANTHER nodes represent the evolutionary events, either speciation or duplication, within the tree. PANTHER is maintaining stable identifier for these nodes.
