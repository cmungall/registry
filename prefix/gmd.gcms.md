name: Golm Metabolome Database GC-MS spectra
description: Golm Metabolome Database (GMD) provides public access to custom mass spectral libraries, metabolite profiling experiments as well as additional information and tools. Analytes are subjected to a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer, which records the mass spectrum and the retention time linked to an analyte. This collection references GC-MS spectra.
