description: CAPS-DB is a structural classification of helix-cappings or caps compiled from protein structures. The regions of the polypeptide chain immediately preceding or following an alpha-helix are known as Nt- and Ct cappings, respectively. Caps extracted from protein structures have been structurally classified based on geometry and conformation and organized in a tree-like hierarchical classification where the different levels correspond to different properties of the caps.
