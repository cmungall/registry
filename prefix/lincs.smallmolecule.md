name: LINCS Small Molecule
description: The Library of Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) Program aims to create a network-based understanding of biology by cataloging changes in gene expression and other cellular processes that occur when cells are exposed to a variety of perturbing agents. The LINCS small molecule collection is used as perturbagens in LINCS experiments. The small molecule metadata includes substance-specific batch information provided by each LINCS Data and Signature Generation Center (DSGC).
